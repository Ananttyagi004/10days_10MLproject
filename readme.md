This is a self taken challange in which I complete 10 ML projects in 10 days                                                                                           
Day 1 SONAR VS MINE project :This is a very basic project to find wether a certain wave is mine or sonar.                                                                 
Algorithm used :Random Forest Classifier.                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                       Day 2 Wine Quality prediction using UCI dataset

This project uses logistic regression to predict wether the quality of wine is good or not.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                        Day 3 A drug recommendation system has been made that tries to give drugs with similar problem                                                                           
The project uses TfidfVectorizer and cosine similarity
